.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a command-line utility aimed at simplifying the task of 
.Dq burning
a USB storage device with a bootable disk image.
The program is interactive, so you can safely call it with no options. Read
.Sx EXAMPLES
section for a quick summary of typical invocations.
.Ss Features
One can use 
.Xr dd 1
utility for hybrid images, but not all images are
hybrid and the operation is error-prone, especially for amateur unix users. In addition to
offering a safety layer (see
.Sx GUARDRAILS
section),
.Nm
will handle hybrid and non-hybrid SYSLINUX or UEFI compliant ISOs such
as any GNU-Linux ISO, Windows ISO or rescue live-cds like UltimateBootCD.
This program also offers other features, such as quickly format a USB
drive, inspecting an image file or listing USB-connected drives.
.Pp
.Nm
can be invoked with two types of options: actions and
modifiers.
Actions determine the goal of the program execution, and
modifiers define the specifics to reach that goal.
At most one action flag can be set. In the absence
of action flag,
.Nm
assumes
.Sy install
action in
.Dq Automatic
mode: inspect
.Ar ISOFILE
boot capabilities and find the best way to make a bootable USB drive
(see
.Sx "INSTALL MODES"
bellow).
.
.Ss Actions
.Bl -tag
.It Fl h, Cm --help
.Sy Help
displays a concise list of options then exits.
.It Fl i, Cm --inspect
.Sy Inspect
.Ar ISOFILE
boot capabilities and how
.Nm
can handle it. In addition, validate this file
against a hash file if one is found, then exit.
.It Fl l, Cm --list-usb-drives
.Sy List USB drives
then exits. Diverse information will be printed such as model,
vendor, size, serial number and device file name which can be later
used with
.Fl d, Cm --device
modifier.
.It Fl p, Cm --probe
.Sy Probe
is equivalent to
.Sy inspect
followed by 
.Sy list USB drives
actions.
.It Fl v, Cm --version
.Sy Version
displays
.Nm
version then exits.
.El
.Ss Generic Modifiers
Use generic modifiers knowingly as some might override default safe behaviors.
.Bl -tag
.It Fl a, Cm --autoselect
Enable
.Dq autoselect
behavior in combination with 
.Cm --assume-yes
modifier.
Autoselect will automatically select a USB drive device if there is exactly one connected
to the system.
.Pp
.Sy Notice:
The
.Dq autoselect
behavior is the default behavior when
.Dq assume yes
is not enabled, unless either
.Cm --device
or
.Cm --no-usb-check
modifiers are set.
.It Fl d Ar DEVICE
Select
.Ar DEVICE
block file as the action target.
When
.Ar DEVICE
is not connected through a USB bus,
.Nm
will fail and exit, unless
.Cm --no-usb-check
is set.
.Pp
.Sy Notice:
Device block files are usually located in 
.Pa /dev/sXX
or
.Pa "/dev/hXX".
.Pa /dev/
prefix can be omitted.
You will be prompted to select a device when not using this modifier.
.It Cm --force-hash-check
Fail and exit when no valid hash is found.
The default behavior is to prompt user when hash check
fails.
.It Cm --local-bootloader
Prevent download of remote bootloader and force local syslinux during installation.
This might work, but could also lower the chances of successful legacy BIOS boot, especially
when the major versions mismatch.
.It Cm --hash-file Ar HASHFILE
Explicitly set the
.Ar HASHFILE
containing the ISO hash. The default behavior is to look for files
matching those conditions:
.Bl -enum
.It
Located in the same folder as
.Ar "ISOFILE".
.It
Which name is the concatenation of
.Ar "ISOFILE",
"." and the hash function name.
.El
.Pp
Supported hash functions are md5, sha1, sha256 and sha512.
.It Fl J, Cm --no-eject
Do not eject device after unmounting after install.
This is the default behavior with
.Sy format
action.
.It Fl M, Cm --no-mime-check
Don't assert that
.Ar ISOFILE
has the right mime-type.
.It Cm --no-size-check
Don't assert that selected device size is larger then
.Ar "ISOFILE".
.It Cm --no-usb-check
Don't assert that selected device is connected through USB bus.
.It Cm --no-wimsplit
Prevent splitting
.Pa /sources/install.wim
file in Windows ISOs.
.It Cm --remote-bootloader Ar VERSION
Force download of
.Xr syslinux
remote bootloader at version
.Ar "VERSION".
Version must follow the pattern MAJOR.MINOR.
Examples: 4.10, 6.04.
That will only work with x64 system architecture.
.It Fl t Ar "FSTYPE", Cm --type Ar FSTYPE
Format to
.Ar FSTYPE
instead of default FAT32 (vfat).
Supported types: vfat, exfat, ntfs, ext2, ext3, ext4, and f2fs.
.Pp
.Sy Important Notice:
usage with
.Sy install
action is discouraged: it cannot work in
.Dq Image-Copy
mode, and it could prevent UEFI boot in
.Dq Mount-Rsync
mode since the UEFI standard mandates a FAT32 partition.
.It Fl L Ar "LABEL", Cm --label LABEL
Set partition label as
.Ar LABEL
instead of inferring.
.Nm
will cut labels which
are too long regarding the selected filesystem limitations.
.Pp
.Sy Note:
It cannot work in
.Dq Image-Copy
install mode.
.It Fl y, Cm --assume-yes
Don't prompt for confirmation before erasing and partitioning USB
device.
.It Cm --
Posix end of options.
.Nm
will not process any option after this flag
and treat the upcoming item as
.Ar "ISOFILE".
.El
.
.Ss Install mode modifiers
These modifiers only apply to default
.Sy install
action, and override
.Dq Automatic
mode (see
.Sx "INSTALL MODES"
bellow).
.Bl -tag
.It Cm "--icopy", Cm --dd
Override
.Dq Automatic
mode and install
.Ar ISOFILE
in
.Dq Image-Copy
mode. 
.It Cm --mrsync
Override
.Dq Automatic
mode and install
.Ar ISOFILE
in
.Dq Mount-Rsync
mode.
.El
.
.
.Sh INSTALL MODES
.Pp
.Nm
has three way of performing the
.Sy install 
action.
.Bl -tag
.It Em Automatic
In the default 
.Dq Automatic
mode,
.Nm
will inspect
.Ar ISOFILE
and choose the best strategy to end up with a
bootable USB stick. These strategies are described in the bellow two modes.
It is advised no to enforce any strategy and let
.Nm
choose.
Invoke
.Cm --inspect
action flag to print identified boot capabilities and the strategy picked up by
.Nm "."
.It Em Image-Copy
In 
.Dq Image-Copy
mode enforcable with 
.Cm --icopy
install modifier,
.Nm
uses
.Xr dd 1
utility to make a raw copy of the ISO.
This is perfectly appropriate when the ISO file is aimed both at disk drives and CDs.
These are special ISOs which have been generated with 
.Xr isohybrid 1 .
A vast majority of GNU-Linux images are shipped with this feature.
.It Em Mount-Rsync
In
.Dq Mount-Rsync
mode enforcable with
.Cm --mrsync
install modifier,
.Nm
creates one partition and a MBR table in the USB drive and copy files
from mounted ISO. The behavior will change depending on the presence of special files to
identify wether legacy BIOS boot or UEFI boot should be preferred.
.Nm
will check conditions to figure out which one to choose:
.Bl -enum
.It
If 
.Pa /efi/boot/*
boot files exist, choose UEFI boot and FAT32 filesystem
mandated by the standard. In which case, if a Windows
.Pa /sources/install.wim
file is found, 
.Xr wimlib-imagex 1
will be used to circumvent FAT32 filesystem size limitations.
You can prevent this behavior with 
.Cm --no-wimsplit
modifier flag.
.It
If  
.Xr syslinux 1
configuration files are found, it will install the
.Xr syslinux
bootloader to allow legacy BIOS boot.
When the local version of
.Xr syslinux
doesn't match ISO version, it will attempt to download the
closest version available in
.UR https://www.kernel.org
https://www.kernel.org
.UE
unless
.Cm --local-bootloader
flag is set.
When invoked with
.Cm --remote-bootloader Ar VERSION
modifier,
.Nm
will ignore local version check and forces download of the
kernel.org version at
.Ar "VERSION".
.It
If none of the above conditions are met,
.Nm
will fail and exit.
.El
.El
.
.
.Sh GUARDRAILS
.Nm
performs a set of tests with user safety and confidence in mind:
.Bl -bullet
.It
Checks
.Ar ISOFILE
hash sum against a hash file if one found. Supported hash algorithms
are md5, sha1, sha256 and sha512.
.It
Checks 
.Ar ISOFILE
mime-type with 
.Xr file 1
utility.
.It
Asserts selected device is connected through USB preventing system damages and exit
if it doesn't, with
.Xr udevadm 1
utility.
.It
Asserts that selected item is not a partition and exit if it doesn't, with
.Xr lsblk 1 .
.It
Asserts that selected image is not larger than selected device.
.It
Prompts for confirmation before erasing and paritioning USB device.
.El
.
.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag
.It Ev SYSLINUX_LIB_ROOT
Set syslinux assets root, where MBR program file will be searched. Defaults to
.Pa /usr/lib/syslinux .
.El
.
.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bl -tag
.It Sy Probe
To have a quick feedback, probe around to check
.Nm
capabilities with given
.Dq file.iso
and list USB drives candidates:
.Pp
.D1 Nm Fl p No file.iso
.Pp
Alternatively, you can use
.Fl i
action flag to solely inspect
.Dq file.iso
or
.Fl l
action flag to solely list USB drives.
.It Sy Install
With the default
.Sy install
action in
.Dq Automatic
mode, give 
.Dq file.iso
as sole argument and you'll be prompted to select from available USB drives.
If there is only one USB device connected,
.Nm
will automatically select it:
.Pp
.D1 Nm No file.iso
.Pp
You can also explicitly set the target USB device:
.Pp
.D1 Nm Fl d No /dev/sde file.iso
.Pp
Avoid being prompted before writting to USB drive and autoselect device when there is
exactly one connected:
.Pp
.D1 Nm Fl ay No file.iso
.It Sy Format
Format the USB drive to NTFS and label it 
.Dq "SONY JOE".
Be careful with the label name, which size and character set is limited by the
target filesystem:
.Pp
.D1 Nm Fl ft No ntfs Fl L No 'SONY JOE'
